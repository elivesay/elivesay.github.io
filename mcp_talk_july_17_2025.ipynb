    "## What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)?\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standardized communication framework that enables AI agents to interact with tools, data sources, and other AI systems in a consistent and reliable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MCP: The HTTP of AI Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as HTTP revolutionized the internet by providing a universal protocol for web communication:\n",
    "- **HTTP** standardized how web browsers request and receive information\n",
    "- **MCP** standardizes how AI agents access tools, retrieve information, and execute tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components of MCP\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Standardized Request Format**: Consistent structure for AI agents to request information or tool usage\n",
    "- **Context Management**: Protocols for handling context windows, memory, and state\n",
    "- **Tool Integration Framework**: Unified methods for connecting to external tools and APIs\n",
    "- **Response Handling**: Standardized formats for receiving and processing results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why MCP Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interoperability**: Allows different AI systems to work together seamlessly\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Simplifies building complex AI systems with multiple components\n",
    "- **Reliability**: Creates consistent patterns for error handling and recovery\n",
    "- **Developer Experience**: Reduces implementation complexity with standardized interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP provides the foundational layer that allows AI agents to reliably interact with the digital world, just as HTTP enabled the explosive growth of the web."
